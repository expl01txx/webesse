People have to be into new technologies, use them every other day and know how does the engine of AI works, to deep into modern world and reach it as fast as we could. Nowadays we can see AI technologies in our life, but not everyone would understand that, for example AI technologies is used in transportation to optimise process of paying and not only. So, to sum up I wanna say that things that are happening now is unbelievable and intangible.
