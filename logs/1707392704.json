First and foremost, I am fully agree with the authors words that the future of development of AI is unpredictable. We never know anything about the future, as we can see from the recent catastrophes (COVID19, closed borders and plenty of wars). So it is impossible to predict future increase of Artificial Intelligent technologies, also because AI brain works exactly the same as the human\u2019s one, so we never know the fully intelligence and possibilities of an AI. As we can observe now the influence of an AI is incredible, however, not always in a good way. Anyone can easily fake anybody\u2019s actions and speeches. And it is vital problem that nobody knows how to solve( that is why NFT was created). Returning to the influence, I can easily say that AI technologies enhance development radically.\nFor example, AI would be able to save corals from dying! And I am sure it is not the end of it\u2019s abilities. However, to understand, support and occur this rapid increase in the nearest future, we need to shift focus on the education. People have to be into new technologies, use them every other day and know how does the engine of AI works, to deep into modern world and reach it as fast as we could. Nowadays we can see AI technologies in our life, but not everyone would understand that, for example AI technologies is used in transportation to optimise process of paying and not only. So, to sum up I wanna say that things that are happening now is unbelievable and intangible. It was really impossible to imagine one hundred years ago that we could have this king of technologies so fast! So I hope that we wouldn\u2019t lose this rapid pace rate and we will upgrade our society by implementation them in our every day life."}], "response": "Recently I have read a really significant article that helped me with understanding the rapid increase in the influence of the new technologies to our every day life about AI. \nRecently, I read a really significant article that helped me understand the rapid increase in the influence of new technologies in our everyday life, specifically about AI.\n- \"Recently I have read\" should be changed to \"Recently, I read\" for correct tense usage. \n- \"helped me with understanding\" should be \"helped me understand\" for smoother sentence structure.\n- \"the influence of the new technologies to our every day life about AI\" should be \"the influence of new technologies on our everyday lives, specifically AI\" for clearer phrasing.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am fully agree with the authors words that the future of development of AI is unpredictable. \nFirst and foremost, I fully agree with the author's words that the future development of AI is unpredictable.\n- \"am fully agree with\" should be changed to \"fully agree with\" for correct verb usage.\n- \"authors words\" should be \"author's words\" to indicate possession.\n- For clarity, \"the future of development of AI\" should be \"the future development of AI.\"\n\nWe never know anything about the future, as we can see from the recent catastrophes (COVID19, closed borders and plenty of wars). \nWe can never know everything about the future, as evident from recent catastrophes (COVID-19, closed borders, and numerous wars).\n- \"We never know anything about the future\" should be \"We can never know everything about the future\" for more accurate expression of uncertainty.\n- Proper formatting for presenting examples is \"COVID-19,\" \"closed borders,\" and \"numerous wars.\"\n\nSo it is impossible to predict future increase of Artificial Intelligent technologies, also because AI brain works exactly the same as the human\u2019s one, so we never know the fully intelligence and possibilities of an AI. \nTherefore, it is impossible to predict the future increase of Artificial Intelligence technologies.

For example, AI would be able to save corals from dying! And I am sure it is not the end of it\u2019s abilities. \nRegarding influence, I can confidently state that AI technologies significantly enhance development. For instance, AI could potentially save corals from dying, and I firmly believe this is just the beginning of its capabilities.\n- \"I can easily say\" should be \"I can confidently state\" for stronger assertion.\n- Properly format examples as \"For instance.\"\n- \"it's abilities\" should be \"its abilities\" to show possession.\n\nHowever, to understand, support and occur this rapid increase in the nearest future, we need to shift focus on the education.
