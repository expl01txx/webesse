You have found some data on the subject \u2013 the results of the opinion polls (see the table below). Comment on the data in the table and give your opinion on the subject of the problem.\n \n\nMusic in an indispensable part of people\u2019s life and has always been popular with teenagers. While working on a music project, I came across a table with statistics revealing the most popular music genres among Zetland teenagers. In my essay I am going to analyse the facts and give my thoughts. \nOverall, as it is shown in the table, the clear majority of teenagers living in Zetland prefer listening to pop music (55.4%) and electronic music with 55.3% of respondents who listen to this genre of music.  According to figures, the least preferred genre of music is classical music with 17.6% of youths who like such type of music. Furthermore, it is notable that a significant number of youngsters polled (49.2% and 27.2% respectively) are fans of R&B and rap and jazz. \nThe number of teenagers who prefer these different types of music, on the other hand, varies substantially. Over 55 per cent of young people polled in Zetland tend to listen to pop music and electronic music, whereas only 17.6 per cent of teenagers in the same city like listening to classical music. The difference between the top and the bottom data in the provided table is about 37 percentage points. It is not surprising that pop music and electronic music are more popular, because there are a lot of popular singers on social media, whose music is usually energetic, exciting, and modern. Moreover, such music reflects the adolescents\u2019 values and are close their lifestyle.\nAccording to the research, young people are more likely to enjoy listening to modern singers and bands than to outstanding composers\u2019 pieces of music. As a result, the younger generation might forget about classical music, which in its turn fosters a sense of beauty. There is, however, a remedy to this issue. Schools and colleges could introduce compulsory music clubs and discussions where students could learn the history of music, some facts about renowned composers and different stages of music development. Such lessons should be organised in an engaging and interesting way to draw students\u2019 interest.\nIn conclusion, I believe that music is a vital part of teenagers\u2019 lives. I believe that listening to quality music is an essential component of intellectual and emotional development. It improves our aesthetic feelings, broadens our horizons, and develops our creativity and imagination.\n"}], "response": "Overall, the essay is well-written and effectively communicates the author's thoughts on the subject of popular music genres among teenagers in Zetland. However, there are a few suggestions to improve the formulation of some sentences and enhance the overall level of English proficiency:\n\n1. Instead of \"While working on a music project,\" consider using \"While conducting research for a music project.\" This change adds more clarity and professionalism to the sentence.\n\n2. In the sentence, \"According to figures, the least preferred genre of music is classical music with 17.6% of youths who like such type of music,\" it would be more appropriate to use \"the least preferred genre of music is classical music, with only 17.6% of youths who enjoy this type of music.\" This revision clarifies the information being presented.\n\n3. Instead of \"Furthermore, it is notable that,\" consider starting the sentence with \"Additionally,\" or \"Moreover.\"\n\n4. In the sentence, \"The number of teenagers who prefer these different types of music, on the other hand, varies substantially,\" it would be more natural to rephrase it as \"The preference for these different types of music among teenagers, on the other hand, varies substantially.\"\n\n5. Instead of \"Over 55 per cent of young people polled in Zetland tend to listen to pop music and electronic music,\" consider saying \"More than 55 per cent of the young people polled in Zetland have a tendency to listen to pop and electronic music.\" It is generally preferable to avoid using \"tend to\" when discussing statistics or percentages.\n\n6. In the sentence, \"Furthermore, such music reflects the adolescents\u2019 values and are close their lifestyle,\" it would be more grammatically correct to say \"Furthermore, such music reflects the values of adolescents and is closely aligned with their lifestyles.\"\n\n7. In the sentence, \"According to the research, young people are more likely to enjoy listening to modern singers and bands than to outstanding composers\u2019 pieces of music,\" consider rephrasing it as \"According to the research, young people are more likely to enjoy listening to modern singers and bands rather than classical compositions by renowned composers.\"\n\n8. Instead of \"As a result, the younger generation might forget about classical music, which in its turn fosters a sense of beauty,\" consider using \"Consequently, the younger generation may overlook classical music, which diminishes their exposure to profound beauty.\"\n\n9. In the sentence, \"There is, however, a remedy to this issue,\" it would be more suitable to say \"Fortunately, there is a solution to this issue.\"\n\n10. Finally, instead of \"I believe that listening to quality music is an essential component of intellectual and emotional development,\" consider rewording it as \"I firmly believe that actively engaging with quality music is a vital aspect of intellectual and emotional development.\"\n\nBy applying these suggested changes, the essay will be even more polished and fluent in both grammar and vocabulary, ultimately improving your English language skills.", "usages": 0}
