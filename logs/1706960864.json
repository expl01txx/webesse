You have found some data on the subject \u2013 the results of the opinion polls (see the table below). Comment on the data in the table and give your opinion on the subject of the problem.\nMusic in an indispensable part of people\u2019s life and has always been popular with teenagers. While working on a music project, I came across a table with statistics revealing the most popular music genres among Zetland teenagers. In my essay I am going to analyse the facts and give my thoughts. \nOverall, as it is shown in the table, the clear majority of teenagers living in Zetland prefer listening to pop music (55.4%) and electronic music with 55.3% of respondents who listen to this genre of music.  According to figures, the least preferred genre of music is classical music with 17.6% of youths who like such type of music. Furthermore, it is notable that a significant number of youngsters polled (49.2% and 27.2% respectively) are fans of R&B and rap and jazz. \nThe number of teenagers who prefer these different types of music, on the other hand, varies substantially. Over 55 per cent of young people polled in Zetland tend to listen to pop music and electronic music, whereas only 17.6 per cent of teenagers in the same city like listening to classical music. The difference between the top and the bottom data in the provided table is about 37 percentage points. It is not surprising that pop music and electronic music are more popular, because there are a lot of popular singers on social media, whose music is usually energetic, exciting, and modern. Moreover, such music reflects the adolescents\u2019 values and are close their lifestyle.\nAccording to the research, young people are more likely to enjoy listening to modern singers and bands than to outstanding composers\u2019 pieces of music. As a result, the younger generation might forget about classical music, which in its turn fosters a sense of beauty. There is, however, a remedy to this issue. Schools and colleges could introduce compulsory music clubs and discussions where students could learn the history of music, some facts about renowned composers and different stages of music development. Such lessons should be organised in an engaging and interesting way to draw students\u2019 interest.\nIn conclusion, I believe that music is a vital part of teenagers\u2019 lives. I believe that listening to quality music is an essential component of intellectual and emotional development. It improves our aesthetic feelings, broadens our horizons, and develops our creativity and imagination"}], "response": ".
