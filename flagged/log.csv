"Recently I have read a really significant article that helped me with understanding the rapid increase in the influence of the new technologies to our every day life about AI. First and foremost, I am fully agree with the authors words that the future of development of AI is unpredictable. We never know anything about the future, as we can see from the recent catastrophes (COVID19, closed borders and plenty of wars). So it is impossible to predict future increase of Artificial Intelligent technologies, also because AI brain works exactly the same as the human’s one, so we never know the fully intelligence and possibilities of an AI. As we can observe now the influence of an AI is incredible, however, not always in a good way. Anyone can easily fake anybody’s actions and speeches. And it is vital problem that nobody knows how to solve( that is why NFT was created). Returning to the influence, I can easily say that AI technologies enhance development radically.
For example, AI would be able to save corals from dying! And I am sure it is not the end of it’s abilities. However, to understand, support and occur this rapid increase in the nearest future, we need to shift focus on the education. People have to be into new technologies, use them every other day and know how does the engine of AI works, to deep into modern world and reach it as fast as we could. Nowadays we can see AI technologies in our life, but not everyone would understand that, for example AI technologies is used in transportation to optimise process of paying and not only. So, to sum up I wanna say that things that are happening now is unbelievable and intangible. It was really impossible to imagine one hundred years ago that we could have this king of technologies so fast! So I hope that we wouldn’t lose this rapid pace rate and we will upgrade our society by implementation them in our every day life.",,,arina,2024-02-05 09:02:59.923451
